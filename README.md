# Hello reader!

## Date 13 September 2019

Data structure and algorithms codes in this repository are sorted by the
language they are written in. Initially I have implemented codes in C and C++
only. I plan to learn Java by implementing the same programs in it. I am
already pro-efficient with Python, but it is too user friendly a language to
learn data structures and algorithms in.

 At the time of this commit, I have already implemented programs for learning
 arrays, linked-lists, stacks, and queues. Some basic tree operations are also
 been done. I will be implementing BST and AVL tree algorithms soon.
 
 Till then, tada!
